# Face-Detection-using-Siamese-Neural-Network

Siamese networks consist of two or more identical networks that share their parameters, i.e., have the exact same weights. The objective of the siamese architecture is not to classify input data, but to differentiate between the inputs.

Pros: 
1.More Robust to Class Imbalance
2.Learning from Semantic Similarity

Cons:
1.Needs More Training Time Than Normal Networks 
2.Donâ€™t Output Probabilities
